**Machine Learning Project: Analysis of Algorithms on Multiple Datasets**

## Overview:
In this machine learning project, I did an extensive analysis of the performance of two distinct algorithms on four datasets. The objective was to gain insights of the algorithm's behavior, evaluate their accuracy and appropriateness, and understand how they interact with various characteristics of the data. This project not only showcases the application of machine learning techniques but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the algorithms to examine and find the most suitable algorithm.

## Datasets:
1. **Insurance Dataset**
2. **Student Performance Dataset**
3. **Weather History Dataset**
4. **Spotify Features Dataset**

## Algorithms:
1. **Naive Bayes Classification**: A supervised machine learning algorithm based on Bayes theorem, used to solve classification problems. One of the simplest and yet most effective classification algorithm used to build fast ML models to make swift predictions.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbor**: Another supervised machine learning algorithm technique which makes predictions based on the similarities between the trained datasets and the new data. The algorithm categorizes the new data into the category with the highest similarity.

3. **Support Vector Machines**: A supervised machine learning algorithm technique which can be used for classification and regression problems. Though highly used for classification problems. SVM algorithm chooses the extreme cases called as support vectors and hence the algorithm is named after that.

4. **Decision Tree Classification**: A supervised machine learning algorithm technique which can be used for classification and regression problems. Though highly used for classification problems. It is a tree structured data classifier, where the branch nodes represent the features or the characteristics of the dataset and the leaf nodes represents the data.

5. **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised machine learning algorithm technique which is used for solving clustering problems. Datasets which are unlabeled are clustered into different clusters up to a maximum of k different clusters. The k value is predetermined.

6. **Linear Regression**: One of the most popular and easiest supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for predictive analysis. Linear Regression makes predictions for continuous/ real or numeric variables. As the name "Linear" suggests, it derives a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s).

7. **Logistic Regression**: One of the most popular supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. Logistic Regression predicts the outcome of the dependent variable and returns a certain probabilistic value in the range of 0 and 1.


## Methodology:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Model Training**
3. **Evaluation With New Case**

## Results:
1. **Insurance Dataset Results**: Through preprocessing and model training, Naive Bayes Classification turned out to be a better and suitable algorithm as it produced a slightly higher accuracy score in comparison to Linear Regression.
2. **Student Performance Dataset Results**: Support Vector Machines or SVM for short proved to be a better model in comparison to Logistic Regression.
3. **Weather History Dataset Results**: Decision Tree classification has been the best algorithm suitable for the better accuracy for the dataset.
4. **Spotify Features Dataset Results**: Using K-Means and KNN algorithm, the data was categorized into different categories into clusters of similar properties.

## Conclusion:
Through this work, I gained valuable experience in preprocessing data, training models, and evaluating their outcomes. This project's findings can serve as a reference for future machine learning endeavors and algorithm selection processes.
